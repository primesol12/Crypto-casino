### Trustworthiness
- Use HTTPS everywhere and implement HSTS to ensure secure connections.
- Display accurate, up-to-date information with clear author or business details and contact options.
- Include an About, Privacy Policy, Terms, and Cookie Policy; comply with GDPR/CCPA where applicable.
- Use verified third-party trust signals where relevant (e.g., business listings, security badges).
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and consistent, professional UI to reinforce credibility.

### SEO optimization
- Implement semantic, valid HTML with proper heading hierarchy (one H1 per page, descriptive H2–H3).
- Write unique title tags (50–60 chars) and meta descriptions (140–160 chars) targeting primary keywords.
- Use descriptive, keyword-relevant, human-readable URLs; avoid query-string clutter for core pages.
- Provide XML sitemap and robots.txt; ensure proper canonical tags to prevent duplicate content.
- Optimize Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms; serve images in next-gen formats and lazy-load non-critical media.
- Add structured data (Schema.org) for organization, products, reviews, breadcrumbs, FAQs, and articles as applicable.
- Ensure mobile-first, responsive design and consistent rendering across modern browsers.

### User engagement
- Design intuitive navigation and clear information architecture with visible CTAs above the fold.
- Provide fast page loads, smooth interactions, and clear feedback on actions.
- Use high-quality, relevant content with scannable layouts (short paragraphs, lists, subheadings).
- Enable on-site search, related content modules, and compelling internal linking to reduce bounce.
- Support micro-interactions and appropriate visuals without distracting from primary goals.

### Click-through rate (CTR)
- Craft compelling, benefit-driven page titles and meta descriptions aligned with search intent.
- Use descriptive, relevant Open Graph and Twitter Card tags for better social previews.
- Implement clear, contrasting CTAs with action verbs; test variations through A/B testing.
- Ensure breadcrumbs and rich results (via structured data) to improve visibility in SERPs.

### Precise keywords
- Perform keyword research (head, mid-tail, long-tail) mapping terms to pages with clear intent (informational, transactional, navigational).
- Integrate primary and secondary keywords naturally in titles, headings, intro copy, alt text, and anchor text.
- Avoid keyword stuffing; prioritize readability and intent matching.
- Maintain a content calendar to target topical clusters and support pillar pages.

### Credible reviews
- Collect and display authentic user reviews and ratings with timestamps and attributions.
- Mark up reviews with appropriate structured data to enable rich snippets.
- Implement moderation to prevent spam and clearly separate testimonials from editorial content.
- Encourage reviews on trusted third-party platforms and reference them where appropriate.

### Readable by crawlers
- Ensure server-side rendered HTML for primary content; if using client-side frameworks, provide hydration/SSR or prerendering.
- Avoid blocking critical resources (JS/CSS/images) in robots.txt; ensure links are standard anchor tags.
- Use pagination best practices (logical linking, avoid thin pages) and handle faceted navigation carefully.
- Provide hreflang where multiple languages/regions are supported; set correct canonical URLs.
- Return correct HTTP status codes (200, 301, 404, 410) and maintain clean redirect maps.

### Content and media
- Create original, authoritative content with clear bylines and update dates.
- Use descriptive alt text, captions where relevant, and optimized file names for images and media.
- Compress images and videos; defer non-critical scripts; preload critical resources.

### Performance and reliability
- Implement caching (HTTP caching, CDN), code splitting, and minification.
- Monitor uptime and errors; set up logging, analytics, and performance monitoring.
- Provide graceful degradation and offline handling where possible (e.g., service worker for PWA features).

### Security and privacy
- Sanitize inputs, protect against XSS/CSRF/SQLi, and apply secure headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
- Use strong authentication and password policies; encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Limit third-party scripts; implement consent management for tracking technologies.

### Analytics and measurement
- Configure privacy-compliant analytics to track key KPIs: sessions, engagement, conversions, Core Web Vitals.
- Implement tracking with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Facebook Pixel.
- Set up goals/events and funnels; define attribution where relevant.
- Use Search Console and server logs to monitor crawl health, index coverage, and query performance.

### Documentation and maintenance
- Provide technical documentation, content guidelines, and an SEO checklist.
- Establish a release process with code review, automated testing, and CI/CD.
- Schedule periodic audits for content freshness, broken links, schema validity, and performance.
